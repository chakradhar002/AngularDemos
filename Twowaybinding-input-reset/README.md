# AssignmentTwo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.2.

## Use Semantic-UI for CSS styling

Located in the project directory at `./node_modules/semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Directions

1. Add an input field which updates a property ('username') via two-way-binding
2. Output the user name property via string interpolation (in a paragraph below the input)
3. Add a button which may only be clicked if the user name is NOT an empty string
4. Upon clicking the button, the user name should be reset to an empty string
