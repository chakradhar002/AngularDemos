    <p>
      The <strong>HTTP 404</strong>, <strong>404 Not Found</strong> and <strong>404</strong> (pronounced "four oh four") error message is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate that the client was able to communicate with a given server,
      but the server could not find what was requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web site hosting server will typically generate a "404 Not Found" web page when a user attempts to follow a broken or dead link; hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors encountered on the World Wide Web.
