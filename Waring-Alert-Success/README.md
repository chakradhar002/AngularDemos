# Assignment - The Basics

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.2.

## Use Bootstrap and Font Awesome CSS styling

Run `npm install bootstrap --save` and `npm install font-awesome --save`, update the `.angular-cli.json` file prior to dev server startup

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.

## Practice

1. Create three new Components (at least one manually): DangerAlert, WarningAlert and SuccessAlert
2. Output them beneath each other in the AppComponent
3. Output a warning or success message in the Components
4. Style the Components appropriately (bootstrap alert alert-success, warning, danger classes?)

Use a mix of external and internal templates and styles!

Create one master component that packages all three components called AlertComponent
