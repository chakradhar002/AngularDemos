# AssignmentThree

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.2.

## Add Semantic-UI

`npm install semantic-ui-css --save`, file is located at '../node_modules/semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css'


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Instructions

1. Add a button which says 'Display Details'
2. Add a paragraph with any content of your choice (e.g. 'Secret Password = tuna')
3. Toggle the displaying of that paragraph with the button created in the first step
4. Log all button clicks in an array and output that array below the secret paragraph (maybe log a timestamp or simply an incrementing number?)
5. Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color (via ngClass)
